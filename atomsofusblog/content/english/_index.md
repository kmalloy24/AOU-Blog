  title: "About Us"
  description: "Hi, we are Chan & Kyle!"
  content: "We love travel, coffee, beer, and adventure! In 2022, we quit our jobs, sold everything we own, and left to travel the country in a campervan. Sounds familiar, right? One thing we‚Äôve noticed since becoming immersed in this lifestyle is that a lot of people feel the same. Which is awesome news because there is such a wonderful and vibrant community of vanlifers/tiny home dwellers/nomads! <br/> <br/> We created this blog because we want to contribute the things we learn as we continue our lives on the road. You can read more about our story and our van, Marty, [HERE](about/)."
